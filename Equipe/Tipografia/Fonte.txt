Fonte:
	Eagle Lake
	The Eagle Lake typeface is a calligraphic lettering style based on 
	the practical Running Book Hand. It has shorter capitals that create
	a visually taller x-height lending to high legibility and fluidity.
	
	Cinzel Decorative
	Cinzel is a typeface inspired in first century roman inscriptions,
	and based on classical proportions. However itâ€™s not a simple revivalism,
	while it conveys all the ancient history of the latin alphabet it also merges
	a contemporary feel onto it.

	Prata
	Prata is an elegant Didone typeface with sharp features and organic teardrops.
	There is a certain tension in the contrast of its virile serifs and soft refined curves.
	Its triangular serifs complement and accent the thin strokes, and the high contrast means
	it will work best in display sizes.
