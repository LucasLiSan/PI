	the practical Running Book Hand. It has shorter capitals that create
	a visually taller x-height lending to high legibility and fluidity.
	
	Cinzel Decorative
	Cinzel is a typeface inspired in first century roman inscriptions,
	and based on classical proportions. However itâ€™s not a simple revivalism,
	while it conveys all the ancient history of the latin alphabet it also merges
	a contemporary feel onto it.
